## Key artifacts

| Path | Kind | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `README.md` | `doc` | Repository overview. |
| `cogant` | `code` | Installable COGANT package root (py/cogant, tests, Rust crates, pyproject.toml). |
| `src` | `code` | Parent-template compatibility shell source. |
| `pyproject.toml` | `code` | Compatibility-shell Python package config. |
| `LICENSE` | `doc` | License. |
| `AGENTS.md` | `doc` | Agent guidance. |
| `CITATION.cff` | `citation` | Machine-readable citation metadata. |

## Portable tasks

## Validation

```bash
python -m aii_platform.aii_sidecar.validate <repo> --completeness
python -m aii_platform.aii_sidecar docs <repo> --overwrite
python -m aii_platform.aii_sidecar.run <repo> --list
```

The sidecar is valid when `validate` prints `OK` and reports no missing artifact,
manifest, link, or declared-doc path. Completeness is a curation target, not a
runtime requirement.

## Data boundary

This sidecar carries metadata only. It does not grant execution permission, does not
replace the repository's own documentation, and must not be used to move private
content into a public repository. Task execution is limited to trusted checkouts.
