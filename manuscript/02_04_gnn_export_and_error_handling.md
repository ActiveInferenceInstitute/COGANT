# GNN export and error-handling philosophy

## GNN export (Generalized Notation Notation)

Exports package the program graph and compiled state-space model into the Active Inference Institute's **Generalized Notation Notation** plus a small set of interop targets:

- **GNN Markdown (`model.gnn.md`)** — canonical, human-readable Generalized Notation Notation organized into the section order defined in `../cogant/docs/export/README.md` (Model Metadata, Repository Metadata, Source Coverage, State Space, Observation Modalities, Actions/Policies, Connections, Factors, Transition Structure, Likelihood Structure, Preferences/Constraints, Time Settings, Parameterization, Ontology Mapping, Provenance, Confidence Scores, Rendering Hints, Validation Notes).
- **GNN JSON (`model.gnn.json`)** — machine-readable equivalent of the markdown sections, plus companion JSON files per section (`state_space.json`, `observations.json`, `actions.json`, `transitions.json`, and so on).
- **Interop exports** — GraphML and Parquet for analysis in Gephi/yEd and DuckDB, and optional tensor views (PyTorch Geometric `Data` objects [@fey2019pyg], DGL graphs, HDF5 tables) for downstream graph neural network training pipelines that consume the program graph as a relational tensor.

Node and edge feature breakdowns, section contracts, and the optional framework targets are specified in `../cogant/docs/export/README.md`; they determine the structure of the emitted notation as well as the effective input dimensionality of any downstream model.

## Error handling philosophy

The implementation distinguishes fatal configuration or parse failures from per-file errors that allow partial results. Validation aggregates warnings and inconsistencies into a report that travels with the bundle. This mirrors the layered error categories documented in the architecture (fatal, error, warning, info).
