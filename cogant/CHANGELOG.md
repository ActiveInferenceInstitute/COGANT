# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to COGANT are documented in this file.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

**Reverse Pipeline (GNN to Code)**
- `cogant.reverse` subpackage: GNN markdown parser, package planner, Python synthesizer, idempotency checker
- Runtime-callable matrix functions (likelihood, transition, EFE, best_action) without exec
- ISOMORPHISM_THEOREM.md: Galois connection proof + epsilon-bounded roundtrip error formalization

**Active Inference Runtime**
- Active Inference agent loop with step/convergence/VFE metrics
- 12-repo Active Inference example zoo with hand-written GNN models for repos 04, 06, 12

**Pipeline and Infrastructure**
- DAG execution engine with topological sort and cycle detection
- Content-addressed result cache keyed on repo sha256
- Entry-point plugin registry + `cogant plugin list/info` CLI
- Schema versioning + `cogant migrate` CLI subcommand
- YAML rule DSL compiled to Python matchers for custom role rules without code
- Structured logging + in-process metrics (Counter, Histogram, span) observability layer

**CLI and Ergonomics**
- `cogant doctor` environment check subcommand
- `cogant init` project scaffolding subcommand
- `cogant explain` rule-level attribution for AI role assignments
- Progress bars, better error messages, rich `--help`
- Composable pydantic config system

**Documentation**
- 16 mkdocs-material documentation sections with tutorials and API reference
- 6 deep concept explainers (GNN, Active Inference, Markov blankets, roles, roundtrip, program graphs)
- 20 cookbook recipes (scan, reverse, CI, custom rules, dataset export)
- 35 honest Q&A FAQ covering accuracy, limitations, and roadmap
- 83+ annotated bibliography entries across 14 themes
- 6 Jupyter tutorial notebooks
- FastAPI demo server
- BENCHMARK_VS_PRIOR.md comparing COGANT vs tree-sitter, pyan, LLM-only, and manual approaches
- CALIBRATION.md with per-rule confidence scores and inline justifications

**Testing and Quality**
- Hypothesis property tests for 7 COGANT correctness laws
- Mutation testing report + targeted hardening tests
- End-to-end pipeline, CLI, and roundtrip integration tests
- ML dataset v0.1: 6 fixtures with node-level role labels (HuggingFace-style card)
- Reproducible 6-fixture benchmark harness with stage timing + memory + GNN stats

**Multi-Language**
- Tree-sitter multi-language substrate with JS/TS parsers
- Git-diff incremental analysis mode

**Theory and Rigor**
- Qualitative AI role validation tests + ACTIVE_INFERENCE_MAPPING.md
- GNN spec compliance: 3 AII non-conformances found and fixed
- Real-world evaluation on 8 open-source Python repositories

### Changed
- Complete README rewrite for v0.2.0 feature set
- Docstring audit and type annotation hygiene across all modules
- Test suite: 1300+ tests, 0 failures (skips for optional deps only)
- py.typed marker added (PEP 561 compliance)
- RuleExplanation model + per-rule `.explain()` with calibration docstrings
- GitHub Actions matrix CI + perf smoke + CODEOWNERS + PR template

### Fixed
- Resolved 6 reverse-module test failures
- ActionRule: extended with encode/decode/dump/load keywords + >=2 WRITES edge fallback
- SemanticMapping export: `mapping.kind.value` (was incorrect attribute access)
- PNG tests: matplotlib-dependent tests properly skipped when `cogant[viz]` not installed
- GNN upstream formatter: DiscreteTime token split, bare variable names in connections
- CI workflows: moved `.github/` to git root so GitHub Actions discovers workflows
- Event pipeline roundtrip xfail documented (47.6% role match -- known synthesizer limitation)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-08

Initial R&D release: forward pipeline (ingest -> static -> normalize -> graph -> translate -> export), 19 translation rules, 7 semantic roles, Markov blanket partition.
